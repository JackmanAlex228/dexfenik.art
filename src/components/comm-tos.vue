                    <li>When drawing anthropomorphic animal characters, I prefer their physique to be more animal than human.</li>
                    <li>I prefer not to draw female anthros with human breasts.</li>
                    <li>I prefer to draw animal characters without clothes, however I can still draw clothes if requested.</li>

                <h3>4. Commission rules</h3>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>A SFW, up-to-date character reference sheet is required. Existing artwork of the character may also work.</li>
                    <li>If you don't have a character reference, I reccomend either coloring a blank template yourself which you 
                        can find online, or commission someone (or myself if available) a lineart ref, which you can color yourself as well.</li>
                    <li>When commissioning me, you also agree with my style choice, meaning the commission will not be streamed and 
                        work in progress shots will not be offered by default.</li>
                    <li>Free WIPs are offered for reference sheets and commissions over $80. For any other commission, I can offer 
                        WIP's at $3 per WIP shot. This is to avoid unpaid work time that can accumulate as a result of drawing revisions.</li>
                    <li>Deadlines might be okay, but because I can't draw full time, fulfillment of such cannot be promised.</li>
                    <li>Payment must be submitted by the time the base sketch is finished.</li>
                    <li>Asking me to work faster, harassing me, or generally being rude is not acceptable and may result in 
                        termination and refund of the commission.</li>
                    <li>Refunds, if needed, are based on the amount of work done.</li>
                    <li>I may refuse a commission if I don’t agree with the characters’ design.</li>
                    <li>Please credit me when artwork is being re-posted.</li>
