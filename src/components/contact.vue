        <p>I'm free to just about any questions, concerns, or anything of the like. If you just 
            want someone to chat with, I'm afraid I don't have enough time to do so with anyone 
            other than my close friends. But I definately can hear from you through the following:</p>
        
        <h3>Email</h3>
        <p>dexfenikfox@gmail.com</p>
        
        <h3>Other ways you can contact me</h3>
        <p>Telegram, Twitter, Instagram, FurAffinity, and DeviantArt DMs. I'm @DexFenik on all of these.</p>

        <h3>There are no stupid questions</h3>
        <p>Please feel free ask me anything on <a href="curiouscat.me/DexFenik">CuriousCat</a>.</p>

        <h3>What NOT to do when contacting me</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Send spam.</li>
            <li>Role play or ask to role play.</li>
            <li>Send one-worded effortless messages such as "hey" or "hi".</li>
