        <p>I'm free to just about any questions, concerns, or anything of the like. If you just 
            want someone to chat with, I'm afraid I don't have enough time to do so with anyone 
            other than my close friends. But I definately can hear from you through the following:</p>
        
        <h3>Email</h3>
        <p>dexfenikfox@gmail.com</p>
        
        <h3>Other ways you can contact me</h3>
        <p>Telegram, Twitter, Instagram, FurAffinity, and DeviantArt DMs. I'm @DexFenik on all of these.</p>

        <h3>There are no stupid questions</h3>
        <p>Please, PLEASE ask me anything on <a href="curiouscat.me/DexFenik">CuriousCat</a>. It's really fun, it makes me 
            feel special, and I would love to populate my Q&amp;A for others to read. </p>

        <h3>What NOT to do when contacting me</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Send spam.</li>
            <li>Role play or ask to role play.</li>
            <li>Send one-worded effortless messages such as "hey" or "hi".</li>
            <li>Harass, threaten, or generally be creepy.</li>
            <li>Send explicit unsolicited images.</li>
            <li>Ask for validation through self-loath or other forms of emotional manipulation.</li>
            <li>Attempt to identify me and my personal life.</li>
            <li>Attempt to persue friendships with me directly.</li>
        </ul>
